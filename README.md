# AdoptDontShop
A React application designed to connect individuals in search of pets with animals in local shelters. I've always been passionate about helping animals, so what better way to express that passion than trying to help out some local pups while engaging another passion -- JavaScript!

The app incorporates Reacts the (fairly) new context API to manage state between the search functionality and the data it renders. There is also a separate branch utilizing redux for this end. 

Note: The app is currently running on an express server but has yet to be hooked up to a backend.

*Any PRs welcome!*
