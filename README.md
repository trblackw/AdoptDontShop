# AdoptDontShop
A React application designed to connect individuals in search of pets with animals in local shelters. I've always been passionate about helping animals, so what better way to express that passion than trying to help out some local pups while engaging another passion -- JavaScript!

The app incorporates Reacts the (fairly) new context API to manage state between the search functionality and the data it renders, though there is a separate branch ('redux') in which I incorporate redux for state management.
The data is received from the PetFinder API (https://www.petfinder.com/developers/api-docs)
